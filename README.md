- 👋 Hi I'm @AnshuS244
- 🖥️ I am learning how to code
- 🧑‍🎓I am a student at Walpole High School
- 📚 I am in 10th grade
- 🏫 This is for my programming class
### Code.org GameLab
[Robot Face](https://AnshuS244.github.io/Robot/)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

[Caption Scene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/2DMdpIfOpv09xCG7lJYXA9ulz2MuKHLwzQophSpyBoQ)
> In this project I made a scene using shapes, variables, randomness, and text.

[Interacive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/feMn4X_8ZxUrB_GRdrQgSeFhUiU4-hbmsu868LxoGtM)
> In this project we made an interactive New Year card by using mouse and keyboard input code and conditionals that change and create sprite animations. I learned how to use player input to add complexity.

[Side Scroller Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/BGWT80nB7jbHkkc2tgkb2lIutFjbid9LDjr-8uMEs7E)
> In this project we used health and score variables. This is an interactive game where the player has to avoid an obstacle and collect points. I learned how to use a score and life variables to change backgrounds and add complexity.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/zhkOo3RXw0jdzYnI0pZHHSalcZtThK-mEzD_Fx7nOko)
> In this project we used a score variable that increases every time the player touches the target. Move the player with the arrow keys and avoid the obstacles. I learned how to use velocity to make it appear as if the player is falling

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/d_KM27ERxEKfqaIU15si_YFqv0VJlJiYy-Qy3xnAswY)
> In this project we made a platformer game using a lives and score variable, conditionals, calling functions, and complex movement. I learned how to use collisions to make a sprite "land" on a platform.

[Final Game Project](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/CISSfEWzBezyatTovmyuiXiNJ8E73HhC3X2XB2ODf98)
> In this project I made a game using 3 different backgrounds to display directions and game outcomes, calling functions, conditionals, and complex movements. This is a game where the player has to avoid obstacles, jump on platforms, and collect swords to increase the score.

### App Inventor
[Hello It's Me Project](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=8981811c-b6b2-480e-96a7-88b30fe7cdbe)
> I used MIT App Inventor to make an app that uses buttons and players that play a sound when you press a button.

[My Piano App](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=50a12b70-2166-4e7e-bcec-ab84d0114df5)
> In this app, I used buttons and players that will play a piano note when the corresponding button is pressed.

[Music Maker App](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=510e751d-2e1c-4721-8194-2f1a035100bd)
> In this app we made a musical soundboard using a boolean expression to record, buttons and players where if a button is pressed then it makes music from the corresponding instrument.

[Find the Gold](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5277856869253120)
> In this app we made a maze where a ball has to move and touch the gold. You control the ball by tilting your screen. We used an accelerometer sensor and notifier to identify if you won or lost.

[Fish Chase Game](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5436261806243840)
> In this game we used variable storage to create a high score. You have to swipe on the screen to move the red ball. Avoid the green ball or you lose. Collect the fish to earn points.

### CMU Python
[Creative Task Unit 1: PacMan](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/blueVioletHorse8126)
> I used python to code shapes and shape properties to create a PacMam scene

[Creative Task Unit 2: Shooting Star](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/chocolateSquirrel4133)
> Me and my partner coded in python to create a shooting star that travels across the screen as the mouse is pressed.

[Creative Task Unit 3: Sunset](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/beigeLobster6171)
> My partner and I made a sunset scene where a sun is user interactive with the mouse, the sky changes colors as the sun dips below the mountains and once the sun is gone you can click and drag up to bring up the moon.

[Creative Task Unit 4: Cookie Cutter](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/powderBlueHippo4669)
> My partner and I made a interactive activity where a user can click on dough and change the shape with the selected cutter (buttons 1, 2, 3).
