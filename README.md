- 👋 Hi I'm @AnshuS244
- 🖥️ I am learning how to code
- 🧑‍🎓I am a student at Walpole High School
- 📚 I am in 10th grade
- 🏫 This is for my programming class
### Code.org GameLab
[Robot Face](https://AnshuS244.github.io/Robot/)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

[Caption Scene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/2DMdpIfOpv09xCG7lJYXA9ulz2MuKHLwzQophSpyBoQ)
> In this project I made a scene using shapes, variables, randomness, and text.

[Interacive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/feMn4X_8ZxUrB_GRdrQgSeFhUiU4-hbmsu868LxoGtM)
> In this project we made an interactive New Year card by using mouse and keyboard input code and conditionals that change and create sprite animations. I learned how to use player input to add complexity.

[Side Scroller Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/BGWT80nB7jbHkkc2tgkb2lIutFjbid9LDjr-8uMEs7E)
> In this project we used health and score variables. This is an interactive game where the player has to avoid an obstacle and collect points. I learned how to use a score and life variables to change backgrounds and add complexity.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/zhkOo3RXw0jdzYnI0pZHHSalcZtThK-mEzD_Fx7nOko)
> In this project we used a score variable that increases every time the player touches the target. Move the player with the arrow keys and avoid the obstacles. I learned how to use velocity to make it appear as if the player is falling

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/d_KM27ERxEKfqaIU15si_YFqv0VJlJiYy-Qy3xnAswY)
> In this project we made a platformer game using a lives and score variable, conditionals, calling functions, and complex movement. I learned how to use collisions to make a sprite "land" on a platform.

[Final Game Project](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/CISSfEWzBezyatTovmyuiXiNJ8E73HhC3X2XB2ODf98)
> In this project I made a game using 3 different backgrounds to display directions and game outcomes, calling functions, conditionals, and complex movements. This is a game where the player has to avoid obstacles, jump on platforms, and collect swords to increase the score.

[Hello It's Me Project](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=8981811c-b6b2-480e-96a7-88b30fe7cdbe)
> I used MIT App Inventor to make an app that uses buttons and players that play a sound when you press a button.

[My Piano App](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=50a12b70-2166-4e7e-bcec-ab84d0114df5)
> In this app, I used buttons and players that will play a piano note when the corresponding button is pressed.

[Music Maker App](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=510e751d-2e1c-4721-8194-2f1a035100bd)
> In this app we made a musical soundboard using a boolean expression to record, buttons and players where if a button is pressed then it makes music from the corresponding instrument.

[Find the Gold](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5277856869253120)
> In this app we made a maze where a ball has to move and touch the gold. You control the ball by tilting your screen. We used an accelerometer sensor and notifier to identify if you won or lost.
